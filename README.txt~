How t use it
------------

pyEdgeworthBox provides with a tool to plot the Edgeworth box and calculate equilibrium, core, pareto effective allocation etc in the pure exchange economy.
These are studied in the microeconomics courses.
A pure exchange economy consists of 2 consumers and 2 goods. Each consumer has her own preferences represented by a utility function and provided with some initial endowment of 2 goods (wich, however, could be 0).
The main class is EdgeBox where you need to put the utilities of each consumer and their initial endowments.
Consider an economy where the first consumer has a utility function u(x,y)=x^0.6*y^0.4 and the bundles of goods A and B (10,20), i.e. she prefers the good A over B.
The second consumer has a utility function u(x,y)=x^0.1*y^0.9 and the bundles of goods A and B (20,10), i.e. he prefers the good B over A.
 
This example (it's example 2b from http://www.pitt.edu/~mjl88/docs/1100/Problem_Set_06_Answers.pdf) can be calculated like this:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import pyEdgeworthBox as eb
    EB=eb.EdgeBox(u1=lambda x,y: x**0.6*y**0.4,u2=lambda x,y: x**0.1*y**0.9,IE1=[10,20],IE2=[20,10])
    EB.plot()

The functions to be handled over must be lambda expressions. So, the utility function of the first consumer u(x,y)=x^0.6*y^0.4 becomes the parameter u1=lambda x,y: x**0.6*y**0.4
Respectively, the utility function of the second consumer u(x,y)=x^0.1*y^0.9 becomes the parameter u2=lambda x,y: x**0.1*y**0.9
Initial endowments are represented by parameters IE1 and IE2 for the 1-st and the 2-nd consumers respectively.

and ``monospace`` look like this.

How to get the calculated concepts
----------------------------------

* Pareto efficient allocations

The points used to draw the Pareto-efficient allocations are stored in PARETO property.
You should be however careful with questions like "Is the allocation (2,3) a Pareto-efficient one?".

* Core

* Eqilibrium price

* Budget line

Caution
-------
The computation is implemented only for the interior solutions!

To Do's:
-------

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going
